# Sorting Visualizer

This small project aims to visualize a few different sorting algorithms and to refresh my knowledge and learn about new sorting algorithms
I haven't used yet. <sup>It's also pretty satisfying to watch</sup>

Try it out here: (add link after deployed)

## Currently available algorithms:

-   Quick Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Heap Sort
-   Bubble Sort
