# Sorting Visualizer

This small project aims to visualize a few different sorting algorithms and to refresh my knowledge and learn about new sorting algorithms
I haven't used yet. <sup>It's also pretty satisfying to watch</sup>

Try it out here: [timii.github.io/sorting-visualizer/](https://timii.github.io/sorting-visualizer/)

## Currently available algorithms:

-   Quick Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Heap Sort
-   Bubble Sort
-   Selection Sort
-   Insertion Sort

## Build it yourself

```shell
git clone https://github.com/timii/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
```

Open index.html in your web browser to launch the visualizer.

Explore, experiment, and learn about sorting algorithms!
