# Sorting Visualizer

## A variety of sorting algorithms visualized.

This visualizer is a small project I made for fun to refresh my knowledge and learn about new sorting algorithms
I haven't used yet. <sub>It's also pretty satisfying to watch</sub>

Try it out here: (add link after deployed)

## Currently available algorithms:

-   Quick Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Heap Sort
-   Bubble Sort
-   Selection Sort
